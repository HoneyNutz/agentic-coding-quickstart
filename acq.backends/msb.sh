# acq.backends/msb.sh — microsandbox (msb) backend adapter for acq
#
# Implements the adapter contract defined in
# docs/adr/0010-acq-pluggable-backends.md ("Adapter contract"). Each
# acq_backend_* function maps the acq contract onto the microsandbox `msb` CLI.
#
# Sourced by acq (via acq_resolve_backend) after common.sh (which sources
# kit-translate.sh) is already loaded. Never run directly.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CLI VERIFICATION STATUS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The flag/subcommand shapes below were verified against the microsandbox CLI
# `msb 0.6.6` (superradcompany/microsandbox v0.6.6, linux/aarch64) via
# `msb --tree` and per-command `--help`. Confirmed present in 0.6.6:
#   - `msb create --name … --net-rule <TOKENS> --trust-host-cas --tls-intercept
#      --secret <ENV@HOST> --copy-file <SRC:DST> --env <K=V> IMAGE`
#   - `msb exec [FLAGS] <NAME> [-u USER] -- CMD…` — msb 0.6.7 accepts the option
#      flags (`-u`, `-t`, `-w`, `-e`) either BEFORE or AFTER <NAME> (getopt-style,
#      order-independent, verified via `msb --tree` / the live openchamber-on-msb
#      verify). This adapter uses flags-after-NAME for the kit-command/marker
#      paths and flags-before-NAME for the interactive attach + `acq exec` paths;
#      both are valid. (A future cleanup could normalize to one order once
#      re-checked against a newer msb; both forms work on the pinned msb.)
#   - `msb list|ls [-q] [--running]`, `msb stop`, `msb remove|rm [-f]`,
#     `msb copy|cp SRC DST`, `msb ssh [SANDBOX] [-- CMD…]`, `msb ssh authorize`,
#     `msb run … -p HOST:GUEST` (published ports), `msb doctor`.
#   - Volume surface (ADR-0023): `msb create … --mount-named
#     NAME:PATH:kind=disk,size=SIZE` (create-or-reuse disk-backed named volume),
#     `--tmpfs PATH:SIZE`, and `msb volume ls -q` / `msb volume rm NAME` for the
#     terminate-time cleanup of derived volumes. LIVE-VERIFIED end-to-end on
#     msb 0.6.12 (macOS HVF) via `scripts/verify-backends --only msb` (17/17):
#     the derived disk volume mounts at boot on a dedicated virtio-blk device
#     of the declared size, and is removed again on `acq rm`. NOTE: msb refuses
#     tiny ext4 disk images ("image size is too small for ext4 formatting";
#     floor 128M on 0.6.12) — kits should stay well above it (~256m floor).
# net-rule grammar (verified from --help): `<action>[:<direction>]@<target>
#   [:<proto>[:<ports>]]`. For a literal hostname the target is the BARE FQDN,
#   e.g. `allow@api.gsa.usai.gov` (per the msb --help example
#   `allow@example.com:tcp:443`).
#
# NOT LIVE-VERIFIED (no /dev/kvm + no nested sandboxes in the build env — see
# ADR-0011 "Validation"): the end-to-end create→exec→attach loop, the exact
# `msb ls` column layout parsed by acq_backend_exists, and secret round-trip to
# a USAi 200. These are marked inline and deferred to a sandbox-capable host.

# a host-side SSH listener against a RUNNING sandbox, and OpenSSH `-L` local
# forwarding then tunnels a guest port to the host with no restart. acq_backend_ports

# _acq_msb_cli — invoke the msb CLI with MSYS argument rewriting disabled
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Under MSYS/Cygwin (Git Bash) the runtime rewrites POSIX-looking argv values to
# Windows form when it launches a native program. That corrupts the paths acq
# hands msb: a colon-delimited mount (`--volume C:/host:/c/guest`) becomes a
# broken `HOST;GUEST` list, and guest-only values (`-w /c/guest`,
# `--env K=/c/guest`, `--mount-named n:/guest:…`) are turned into `C:/…`.
#
# acq therefore computes BOTH forms explicitly — host_path() for values a native
# tool resolves on the host, canonicalize_path() for values that name something
# inside the guest — and msb must receive them verbatim.
# MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*' disables the rewrite for this one child; it is inert
# off MSYS, so POSIX hosts are unaffected. `msb` is invoked WITHOUT `command` so
# a shell-function shim (tests) or the PATH executable is honored as before; the
# env assignment still reaches the real process either way. See ADR-0029.

# Minimum msb version required. Two reasons pin this to 0.6.9:
#   1. 0.6.8 is the first release with the `--net-default-egress` /
#      `--net-default-ingress` split that the balanced-egress baseline (on by
#      default, ADR-0018/0019) relies on — earlier 0.6.x had the neutral net
#      rules, --trust-host-cas, and --secret used here, but only the symmetric
#      `--net-default`, so a plain `acq create` would pass an unknown flag to a
#      0.6.0-0.6.7 binary and clap would hard-error.
#   2. 0.6.9 is the first release where the semantic `allow@dns` macro parses
#      correctly on release builds (the upstream release-build parser fix). On
#      <= 0.6.8 that macro hard-failed on release binaries, so the gateway-DNS
#      grant had to be emitted as an expanded udp/tcp:53 pair. The baseline
#      emitter now uses `allow@dns` directly (see ADR-0018), which requires 0.6.9.
# Fail closed on the floor instead (acq_backend_prepare) so the failure mode is a
# clear version message, not a raw clap error or DNS parse failure mid-create.

# default.
MSB_ROLLBACK_VERSION="0.6.18"

# First release with the upstream fix. Moving FORWARD to this is the preferred
# recovery for a host that already ran a blocked version: the migration sets are
# additive, so this line reads an already-migrated catalog with no rollback and no
# state rewrite. Rolling back needs `msb self downgrade` run BY the blocked binary
# (it owns the rollback metadata), and can be refused outright when grouped or
# duplicate snapshots exist. See ADR-0032.
MSB_FIXED_VERSION="0.7.3"

# Default OCI image for provisioned sandboxes. We default to the SAME image
# family sbx uses: `docker/sandbox-templates:shell-docker`, an Ubuntu-based
# agent template. It ALREADY ships the non-root `agent` user (with passwordless
# sudo), node, git, curl, and ca-certificates (the four kits' runtime
# prerequisites), AND an agent-writable npm global prefix
# (/usr/local/share/npm-global) — so `npm install -g` by the agent user works
# without sudo and without EACCES. Defaulting here makes msb match sbx by
# construction and removes the need to synthesize the agent user / sudo on a
# plain OCI base. It is pullable from Docker Hub without registry auth.
#
# We deliberately do NOT apt-install prerequisites at runtime: the kit net-rules
# lock egress to only the kits' own hosts (api.gsa.usai.gov, github.com, ...),
# so a package mirror is unreachable during provision. This still matters for a
# custom base — bake the tools into the image rather than expecting a runtime
# install. Override with ACQ_MSB_IMAGE to bring your own (e.g. a lighter or
# org-internal image, or a plain OCI base) — a custom image must still provide
# the prerequisites; see the prerequisite contract below.

# ACQ_IMAGE, with a one-time notice, so a user who deliberately set the msb var is
# never silently overridden. The resolution runs at provision time (not here at

# The kits expect an unprivileged `agent` user with HOME=/home/agent (the sbx
# agent-template contract). The default image already provides it; but a plain
# OCI base override (e.g. node:22-bookworm) does not, so the adapter creates it
# at provision (see _acq_msb_ensure_agent_user), addressing it by NAME — the uid
# is whatever the base image leaves free (1000 is often taken by a pre-existing
# user, e.g. `node` on node:22-bookworm).

# Guest memory and vCPU allocation.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# msb 0.6.x defaults a sandbox to 512 MiB RAM and 1 vCPU (see the microsandbox
# config defaults DEFAULT_MEMORY_MIB=512 / DEFAULT_CPUS=1). The microVM has NO
# swap, so a process that exceeds guest RAM is OOM-killed by the guest kernel and
# simply prints "Killed". A Node.js agent TUI like opencode blows past 512 MiB
# immediately, so a create with no memory flag left the user with an agent that
# started and was instantly killed. sbx sizes its
# agent templates generously; msb runs a plain base and must be told, so acq
# passes a generous default here (4 GiB / 2 vCPU) and lets it be tuned.
#
# `msb create` accepts `-m/--memory SIZE` and `-c/--cpus N` (verified against the
# microsandbox SandboxOpts). SIZE takes a single-char unit suffix: `G`/`g` = GiB,
# `M`/`m` = MiB, and a bare number = MiB (there is NO multi-char MiB/GiB suffix).
# So `4G`, `4096`, and `4g` are equivalent. Set ACQ_MSB_MEMORY empty to omit the
# flag and fall back to msb's 512 MiB default (uses `-`, not `:-`, so an
# explicitly-empty value disables the flag rather than re-defaulting). Same for
# ACQ_MSB_CPUS.

# Guest DNS. msb forwards guest queries from its HOST-SIDE network stack to the

# split-horizon names: on a ZPA host, gitlab.login.gov and api.gsa.usai.gov
# resolve to private 100.64.x addresses that ride the tunnel's allow-listed
# path, while a public resolver returns the public load balancer, which rejects

# when the host's own resolvers sit in 100.64.0.0/10, the CGNAT range ZPA uses

# an allowed domain whose DNS an attacker influences could steer the guest at
# private space (other tunnel app segments, the msb gateway) under that rule.
# Mitigations that remain: only named kit hosts are allowed under
# strict/balanced, answers come from the host's corporate resolver over the
# tunnel, IP-group rules (allow@public) never admit private addresses, and
# injected secrets are bound to the upstream TLS identity so a rebound endpoint

# network"; see docs/KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md §30, which separates that broad-egress
# failure (stale msb state; fixed by a data wipe + reinstall) and the USAi
# split-horizon DNS failure (needs a resolver that can see the internal zone) from
# this genuine-interception case.
#
# acq enables msb `--tls-intercept` so msb can substitute injected secrets on the
# wire (see the --tls-intercept block in acq_backend_provision). That runs a
# HOST-SIDE TLS proxy which re-originates an outbound TLS connection to the real
# server. Behind a terminating corporate proxy that "real server" is the proxy
# itself, presenting a corporate-signed leaf, so msb's proxy must trust the
# CORPORATE ROOT on its UPSTREAM leg.
#
# msb verifies that upstream leg against the host's native trust store. Crucially,
# `--trust-host-cas` does NOT help here — it only ships host CAs into the GUEST,
# not into the proxy's upstream verifier. When the host's native-cert enumeration
# does not surface the corporate root (uneven on macOS: it depends on which
# keychain / trust-settings domain the root lives in), the upstream handshake
# fails AFTER the guest-facing TLS already completed, and the guest client sees
# `curl: (56) … unexpected eof` for every terminated host — not a 401.
#
# FIX: pass the corporate root explicitly to msb's UPSTREAM verifier via
# `--tls-upstream-ca-cert <PEM>` (msb ADDS it to the native roots; the flag is
# repeatable / a file may bundle multiple certs). Two ways to supply it:
#
#   1. ACQ_MSB_UPSTREAM_CA_CERT — explicit path(s) to PEM file(s) (colon- or
#      space-separated). Highest precedence; passed through verbatim. Use this
#      when you already have the corporate root on disk, or on non-macOS hosts.
#
#   2. Auto-detect (macOS default, on). When no explicit path is set, acq exports
#      the host's search-list root CAs to a PEM under its state dir and passes
#      THAT. This captures the corporate root exactly as the host trusts it,
#      sidestepping the native-cert loader's keychain/trust-settings gaps. Toggle
#      off with ACQ_MSB_UPSTREAM_CA_AUTODETECT=0.
#
# Normalized like the other on/off toggles. Auto-detect only runs on macOS (it
# uses the `security` tool); elsewhere it is a no-op and only the explicit path
# (option 1) applies.

# Balanced egress baseline (ADR-0018)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# msb defaults guest egress to NONE, so without a baseline an msb sandbox is far
# more locked down than an sbx one (whose "balanced" policy allows a broad set of
# dev hosts: AI services, package registries, code/container hosts, cloud infra,
# OS packages, cert-validation hosts). To reach parity, acq applies the SAME host
# set as the sbx "balanced" policy by default: it emits `--net-default-egress deny`
# plus an `allow@<host>:tcp:<port>` rule per entry in the vendored host list, on top
# of the kits' own caps.network.allow. Egress is therefore restricted TO the balanced
# set (deny-by-default + allowlist), matching sbx "balanced". The deny-default is
# scoped to EGRESS only (ADR-0019): ingress keeps msb's baseline `allow` so
# create-time `-p HOST:GUEST` published ports stay reachable (a symmetric
# `--net-default deny` would RST inbound to them).
#
# Network egress posture is selected by the NEUTRAL tier vocabulary
# `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER` (strict|balanced|open, default balanced), which the patterns
# network-tiers contract (agentic-coding-patterns ADR-0002) defines for all
# backends. This adapter maps the tier to msb's native egress primitive at
# provision time (see acq_backend_provision):
#
#   strict   = deny-by-default egress, kit caps.network.allow ONLY (no baseline).
#              The most locked-down posture; recommended for GFE / high-assurance.
#   balanced = deny-by-default egress + the curated baseline (the sbx "balanced"
#              mirror in msb-balanced-hosts.txt, ADR-0018) UNIONED with the kits'
#              own allow rules. The default when unspecified.
#   open     = unrestricted egress (no deny-default). Testing only, never GFE;
#              gated behind an explicit confirmation (see ACQ_NETWORK_TIER below).
#
# ALL tiers keep deny-by-default EXCEPT open; the tier only sizes the baseline
# allowlist. This normalizes to a lowercase enum, fail-closed to `balanced` on an
# invalid value.
#
# DEPRECATED ALIAS — `ACQ_MSB_BALANCED_EGRESS` predates the neutral tier and is
# retained for one deprecation window. It maps into the tier fail-safe (tighter,
# never looser): a "1"/on value -> `balanced`; a "0"/off/empty value -> `strict`
# (NOT the old permissive no-deny-default behavior — an upgrade must never
# silently loosen egress). `ACQ_NETWORK_TIER` wins when both are set. A one-time
# notice points the user at the neutral selector. The alias is removed in a

# the value, so the value must be present in the environment at BOTH create and

# it entirely, which made `msb start` fail with "host environment variable
# USAI_API_KEY is not set". Factoring it here guarantees start binds the
# identical set create did.
#
# The caller passes the NAMES of two arrays by reference: ARRVAR receives the

# acq_backend_start NAME — start (resume) a stopped sandbox (ADR-0017)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `msb start` resumes a stopped sandbox, preserving its persisted state
# (ACQ_BACKEND_CAN_RESUME=1). Microsandbox's `start_detached` replays only a
# persisted `runtime.entrypoint`/`runtime.cmd` on start — NOT a bare
# `--script-path`-registered script (source-verified; see ADR-0017 and
# _acq_msb_stage_startup_script). So starting alone does NOT deterministically
# bring kit `startup`/`background` services back up; that restoration is done by
# the acq `start`/`restart` verb re-driving acq_backend_ensure_kits_applied
# (which re-runs startup via the idempotent exec path). This function is the thin
# resume primitive; the dispatcher owns the heal that follows.
#
# PORT SYMMETRY: acq_backend_stop tears down post-hoc `msb ssh serve` + `ssh -L`
# port tunnels (ADR-0015) because a stopped guest can no longer serve them. There
# is NO matching re-establish primitive here: those tunnels are created on demand
# by `acq ports --publish` against a RUNNING sandbox and are not persisted, so a
# resumed sandbox simply has no post-hoc tunnels until the user re-publishes.
# (Create-time `-p HOST:GUEST` NAT mappings are part of the sandbox config and
# are restored by msb itself on start.) Left as a deliberate no-op with this note.
#
# READINESS (S1 fix): `msb start` returns as soon as the resume is registered,
# but the guest boots asynchronously — so the FIRST `msb exec` after a start can
# race the boot (same failure mode as post-create). We therefore BLOCK on
# _acq_msb_wait_for_exec_ready here so that EVERY caller (the acq start/restart
# verb, the start-if-stopped block inside acq_backend_ensure_kits_applied, and
# any future caller) gets a booted, exec-ready guest — the heal's first exec can
# never race the boot regardless of entry path. On the verb path,
# acq_backend_start runs BEFORE ensure_kits_applied's _acq_msb_is_running check;
# without a wait here that check would see the sandbox already running and skip
# its own readiness wait, letting the first heal exec race the boot. Encapsulating
# the wait in the resume primitive keeps the dispatcher backend-neutral (no
# msb-specific readiness logic leaks into acq). _acq_msb_wait_for_exec_ready is
# defined below in this file (single source, reused by the post-create and the
# start-if-stopped paths). The wait is best-effort: a timeout emits a warning
# rather than aborting, mirroring the start-if-stopped path.
#
# SECRETS (fix): `msb start` re-reads the sandbox's persisted `--secret ENV@HOST`
# bindings and REQUIRES each named value to be present in the host environment at
# start time — msb does not retain the value across a stop. Provision exported
# these before `msb create`; resume must do the SAME before `msb start`, or msb
# fails with "host environment variable USAI_API_KEY is not set". We re-derive
# the identical binding set from the acq store via _acq_msb_bind_secrets_into
# (shared with provision), export the values transiently, run `msb start`, then
# unset them so the values never linger. The collected --secret flags are unused
# here (msb already persisted the bindings at create); only the exported values

# Kit application helpers (msb drives the neutral spec itself)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# DESIGN NOTE — the staging boundary: create-time `--script-path` for the
# startup phase, `msb exec` for install and every mid-life apply (ADR-0017).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# msb 0.6.7 offers first-class script registration on `create`/`run`:
#   --script NAME=BODY        (inline; escape-decoded; shebang from --shell)
#   --script-raw NAME=BODY    (exact bytes, no shebang)
#   --script-path NAME:PATH   (body read verbatim from a host file)
# Registered scripts land executable at /.msb/scripts/<name>, on the guest PATH.
#
# An earlier revision of this adapter kept ALL kit-command staging on `msb exec`
# and treated `--script*` as net-negative, on the grounds that kit commands run
# both at create AND mid-life and that the exec path never interpolates kit
# bytes into a shell string. Both of those observations are still true — but they
# do NOT apply to one specific slice, and ADR-0017 carves that slice out:
#
#   THE ONE CLEAN WIN IS THE CREATE-TIME, RE-RUNNABLE STARTUP BODY.
#   A kit's `startup`-phase commands are re-run on EVERY apply (they carry no
#   run-once marker — unlike install), and they are exactly what a microsandbox-
#   native restart (`msb stop`+`msb start`, or a reboot that restarts the guest)
#   must replay to bring kit background supervisors back up. microsandbox can
#   replay them itself only if it holds them as a registered startup script. So
#   we now STAGE the startup phase as a single create-time script registered via
#   `--script-path` (see _acq_msb_stage_startup_script). That is a genuinely
#   create-time-only, re-runnable command body whose natural form is a script
#   file — the narrow case the older note itself named as the clean win, which
#   ADR-0017 confirms now exists in the pinned vocabulary (the `startup` phase).
#
#   WHY `--script-path` (not --script / --script-raw): the body is read VERBATIM
#   from a host file, so we never hand microsandbox a shell string assembled from
#   kit content, and we do not depend on shebang derivation from --shell — the
#   generated body carries its own `#!/bin/sh`. The generated file emits each kit
#   argv token single-quote-escaped (SI-10): kit bytes become quoted data inside
#   a here-shaped command line, never an interpolated program fragment.
#
# THE BOUNDARY — what stays on `msb exec`, and WHY it MUST:
#
#   1) INSTALL PHASE stays exec-based. install commands are run-once, gated by a
#      root-owned marker keyed on a hash of the argv
#      (_acq_msb_exec_install: /var/lib/acq/install-<cksum>), tested+written as
#      uid 0 so the gate is independent of the command's own user. A create-time
#      script re-runs on every restart by design — the OPPOSITE of run-once — so
#      folding install into the startup script would break its idempotency
#      contract. install therefore stays out of the staged script entirely.
#
#   2) MID-LIFE APPLY stays exec-based. _acq_msb_apply_kit_dir is also driven
#      long after create by acq_backend_apply_kit (`acq kit apply NAME KITREF`)
#      and by acq_backend_ensure_kits_applied (the re-attach heal loop). A
#      create-time flag cannot register a script into an ALREADY-RUNNING sandbox,
#      so the mid-life path MUST stay exec-based regardless. Create-time staging
#      owns the reboot/`msb start` replay path; exec owns the in-place kit-add /
#      heal path. They are complementary, not a fork: do not collapse one into
#      the other.
#
#   3) FILE STAGING IS ORTHOGONAL. files[] stage via `msb copy` + verify + chown
#      (_acq_msb_copy_file_verified); paths are charset-validated and never
#      interpolated. `--script-path` covers only the startup COMMAND body, not
#      files[], so it does not subsume that path.
#
# INCREMENT BOUNDARY (ADR-0017 delivers this in two steps). This adapter now
# implements BOTH the create-time startup-script staging AND the restart-durable
# behavior that consumes it:
#
#   * The acq `start`/`restart` verb calls acq_backend_start (`msb start`) then
#     re-drives acq_backend_ensure_kits_applied, which re-applies the pinned kits
#     idempotently and RE-RUNS the startup phase via `msb exec` — restoring kit
#     `startup`/`background` services on resume. A stopped sandbox is also started
#     automatically at the TOP of ensure_kits_applied, so `acq run
#     <stopped-sandbox>` heals then attaches. This is the deterministic path and
#     needs no native persistence.
#
# A native `msb start` OUTSIDE acq is intentionally NOT supported: microsandbox's
# start_detached replays only runtime.entrypoint/runtime.cmd (not the
# --script-path-registered script), AND — more fundamentally — `msb start`
# requires the sandbox's `--secret ENV@HOST` host env vars to be present, which
# only acq injects (see acq_backend_start). So a raw `msb start` of a
# secret-bound sandbox fails before any startup question arises. Always resume
# via `acq start`/`acq restart`.
#
# The `--script-path` registration itself is runtime-neutral: it only stages the
# body on the guest PATH (/.msb/scripts/acq-startup) so a kit author or the exec
# heal can invoke it by name; microsandbox does not auto-run it at start.
# install + mid-life apply stay exec-based.

# policy inspect local-policy`) and translates each `host:port` line into a rule,
# per the msb grammar (`allow[:egress]@<target>[:<proto>[:<ports>]]`):
#   - PORT: trailing `:port` -> `:tcp:<port>` (sbx "balanced" is TCP; a host on

#   - WILDCARD / intra-label glob: see _acq_msb_balanced_target.

#     hosts: under `--net-default-egress deny` the high-level DNS auto-grant does
#     not apply, so a low-level rule must grant it explicitly. We use msb's

# Create-time startup-script staging (ADR-0017)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These helpers GENERATE a single host-side `/bin/sh` script that reproduces the
# semantics the exec path applies to STARTUP-phase kit commands, and stage it as
# a `--script-path acq-startup:<hostpath>` create flag. See the DESIGN NOTE above
# for the boundary: only the `startup` phase is staged here; install and mid-life
# apply stay exec-based. A bare `--script-path` registration is runtime-neutral
# (staged on the guest PATH, not auto-run at boot); the acq `start`/`restart`
# verb re-runs startup via the exec heal.
#
# TRANSLATION from the exec path to an IN-GUEST script:
#   - The exec path picks run-as-user via `msb exec -u agent`/`-u <user>`. Inside
#     the guest the script cannot use `msb exec`, so it runs each command through
#     `su`/`runuser` (whichever exists) for the agent/uid-1000 case, and directly
#     for root. HOME=/home/agent is set for the agent case exactly as the exec
#     path sets `-e HOME=/home/agent`.
#   - The kit environment[] vars and the non-interactive git guards
#     (GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0, GIT_ASKPASS/SSH_ASKPASS=/bin/false unless the kit
#     set GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT) are emitted as an `env NAME=value …` prefix on the
#     command — the in-guest equivalent of the exec path's `-e` flags. The prefix
#     uses the portable, busybox-safe `env NAME=value … sh -c 'exec "$@"' sh ARGV`
#     form: NO `--` terminator (unsupported by busybox/alpine `env`); see
#     _acq_msb_startup_emit_command for the full rationale.
#   - A `background:true` startup command is detached with the SAME nohup wrapper
#     the exec path uses (`nohup … >/dev/null 2>&1 & exit-through`), so a
#     never-exiting supervisor does not block the script.
#
# SI-10 / ESCAPING: kit-provided argv tokens and env values are NEVER interpolated
# as shell fragments. Each argv token and each env value is single-quote-escaped
# by _acq_msb_sq (embedded single quotes become '\'' ) before it is written to
# the file, so kit bytes are emitted as inert quoted DATA, not executable syntax.
# The body is a FILE read verbatim by `--script-path`; acq never assembles a
# shell string from kit content and hands it to msb.

# generated /bin/sh script line. Embedded single quotes become the classic

  # end-of-options terminator is a GNU coreutils >= 8.30 extension and is NOT

  # `env FOO=bar -- echo hi` fails with `env: '--': No such file or directory`.

# content is never world-readable) and recorded in _ACQ_MSB_STARTUP_STAGE_FILES
# for cleanup by the caller after create. A kit with no startup commands stages
# nothing (no empty script is registered).
#
# NOTE (single-stake): only the FIRST kit that contributes startup commands stakes
# the fixed `acq-startup` script name; if multiple kits carried startup commands
# they would need a merged/uniquely-named script — but the pinned built-in kits
# put startup commands in a single kit, and multi-kit merging is deferred. Guarded
# here so a second contributing kit does not silently overwrite the first's
# registration; the exec-based apply path still runs EVERY kit's startup after
# create, so nothing is dropped at runtime.
#
# VERIFIED NEUTRALITY ASSUMPTION (ADR-0017): registering a script via
# `--script-path acq-startup:<file>` only STAGES the body on the guest PATH (as
# /.msb/scripts/acq-startup) — it does NOT enroll the script in microsandbox's
# persisted startup, so microsandbox does NOT auto-run it at guest boot. This was
# confirmed against microsandbox source: `crates/cli/lib/commands/start.rs` and
# `restart.rs` re-run a persisted startup command derived from
# runtime.entrypoint/runtime.cmd on `Sandbox::start_detached()`, NOT from
# runtime.scripts. So a bare `--script-path` registration is present but inert at
# boot. Restart durability is therefore provided by the acq `start`/`restart`
# verb + start-if-stopped-on-`acq run`, which re-runs the startup phase via the
# exec heal (the deterministic mechanism). A native `msb start` OUTSIDE acq
# cannot re-run startup on its own — and, more fundamentally, cannot even boot a
# secret-bound sandbox, because `msb start` requires the `--secret` host env vars
# that only acq injects (see acq_backend_start). Native-restart-outside-acq is
# therefore out of scope by construction; go through `acq start`/`acq restart`.
#
# This inertness is load-bearing and unverifiable from this repo, so it MUST be
# re-verified on each msb version bump — if a future msb auto-runs a registered
# `--script-path` at boot, kit startup would double-run (boot replay + acq heal).

# _acq_msb_clone_copy_config SRC SCRATCH — write the few repo-local config
# values a clone drops but the guest needs, from SRC into the scratch (see
# ADR-0027 for what a clone carries and why):
#   - user.name/user.email: SRC's EFFECTIVE identity. A per-forge identity
#     often lives only in .git/config or behind a gitdir-scoped includeIf; the
#     guest's synced global tier cannot express a per-repo value, so without
#     this the first in-guest commit fails with "Author identity unknown".
#     `git -C SRC config --get` resolves it exactly as the user's own commits do.
#   - remote.origin.url/remote.origin.pushurl: `git clone <host path>` points
#     the scratch's origin at the host checkout path, and the scratch is
#     mounted AT that path in the guest — so origin resolves to the scratch
#     itself (fetch is a no-op, push cannot reach the real remote). Copy the
#     RAW values (`config --get-all`, not `remote get-url`): that is what
#     .git/config holds and what sbx carries, and a host insteadOf rewrite is
#     host policy the guest never receives, in EITHER direction: an https->ssh
#     rewrite would hand the guest a transport it has no key for, and under an
#     ssh->https rewrite (common for token auth) the raw value IS the ssh form,
#     so the guest gets that same unusable transport. Only user.* reaches the
#     guest's global tier, so nothing corrects it there; raw is still the right
#     default because it is what the checkout itself holds. A credential embedded
#     in the URL travels with it, as it does in a direct mount of the checkout.
# Every value of a key is carried, in order: a remote URL is legitimately
# multi-valued (`remote set-url --add`, push-to-two-forges) and git fetches the
# FIRST value while `config --get` returns the LAST, so a single-value copy
# would silently point the scratch at the wrong forge. Values are read
# NUL-delimited (`-z`): git allows a newline inside a value, and a line-oriented
# read would split one URL into two push targets.
# A key absent from SRC is unset in the scratch, so the scratch mirrors SRC for
# these four keys: in particular a source with no origin leaves the scratch with
# none, rather than the host-path origin `git clone` installed (see above), so
# an in-guest push fails loudly instead of landing in the scratch.
# Running git inside the scratch is safe HERE only: acq just created it and it
# is not yet guest-exposed (see the rm-time rule in _acq_msb_clone_warn_unfetched).
# Unlike the global-identity forwarder in common.sh there is no
# control-character filter: the values go through `git config`, which escapes
# on write, never onto a command line.
# Failure policy: a config that cannot be read (any status but 1, "no such
# key") or a value that cannot be written ABORTS the create for the origin
# keys, returning 1 — a scratch whose origin still resolves to itself makes an
# in-guest `git push origin` LOOK successful while reaching no forge, and a
# warning cannot be trusted to prevent that. For the identity keys it only
# warns: a missing identity already fails loudly at the first in-guest commit.

  # Balanced egress baseline (ADR-0018): mirror the sbx "balanced" host set so an
  # msb sandbox reaches the same dev hosts. msb defaults egress to none, so we
  # make the restriction explicit and deterministic. The NEUTRAL network tier
  # (ACQ_NETWORK_TIER; strict|balanced|open, default balanced — see the module
  # header and agentic-coding-patterns ADR-0002) selects how much egress the
  # sandbox gets, all deny-by-default except `open`:
  #   balanced -> `--net-default-egress deny` + the curated baseline
  #               (`allow@<host>:tcp:<port>` per vendored entry + gateway DNS via
  #               the `allow@dns` macro) UNIONED with the kit/npm/secret
  #               `allow@…` rules under first-match-wins.
  #   strict   -> `--net-default-egress deny` + gateway DNS, but NO baseline:
  #               egress is the kits' own `allow@…` hosts ONLY. Same deny-default
  #               posture as balanced, smaller allowlist.
  #   open     -> NO deny-default emitted; kit/npm/secret allows ride msb's own
  #               (permissive) egress default. Gated behind an explicit confirm
  #               token; validated below before we reach here.
  # The baseline rules are emitted BEFORE the npm-host rule so all allow rules sit
  # together after the deny-default.
  #
  # EGRESS-ONLY, DELIBERATELY (ADR-0019): we emit `--net-default-egress deny`, NOT
  # the symmetric `--net-default deny`. msb's `--net-default` sets BOTH directions
  # (verified in msb 0.6.8 `--help`: "Sets egress and ingress symmetrically") and
  # there is NO implicit ingress-allow for a published port — every inbound
  # connection is evaluated against the ingress default, so a symmetric deny RSTs
  # inbound traffic to a create-time `-p HOST:GUEST` port (the connection completes
  # the handshake via msb's host proxy, then resets on data → ERR_CONNECTION_RESET
  # on the host). Restricting only egress leaves the ingress default at msb's
  # baseline `allow`, so published ports stay reachable with no per-port ingress
  # rule. A future "strict" ingress profile can layer ingress deny-default + explicit
  # per-port `allow:ingress@…` rules; the tiers here intentionally set egress only.
  # Requires msb >= 0.6.8 (the `--net-default-egress`/`--net-default-ingress`

  # Translate the caller's workspace path(s) into --volume mounts.

  # CONTRACT (matches sbx semantics — see docs/CONCEPTS.md "Multiple
  # Workspaces"): every workspace positional after the agent is mounted at its
  # SAME absolute path inside the guest (all workspaces appear inside the
  # sandbox at their absolute host paths). A trailing `:ro` marks that mount
  # read-only. `acq run opencode ~/app ~/lib:ro` therefore mounts ~/app rw and
  # ~/lib ro, each at its own host path.
  #
  # STARTING DIRECTORY (ACQ_MSB_GUEST_WORKSPACE, consumed by attach): the FIRST
  # workspace positional is the "primary" — the agent starts there — regardless
  # of how many mounts are given (docs/CONCEPTS.md: the primary workspace is the
  # first path and the agent starts there). ACQ_MSB_WORKSPACE overrides it.
  #
  # Why mount at the host path (not remapped under /home/agent): `msb create`
  # performs the mount at create time, BEFORE acq can create the `agent` user and
  # /home/agent (that happens post-create, once the guest is exec-ready). A plain
  # base override (e.g. node:22-bookworm) has no /home/agent, so mounting into it
  # failed with
  # "mount ...: Not a directory (os error 20)". Mounting at the host's own
  # absolute path sidesteps the ordering problem and matches sbx. NOTE: msb also
  # cannot mount a SYMLINKED host path (e.g. macOS $TMPDIR under /var ->
  # /private/var); each path is canonicalized below before the mount.

# sbx's agent templates are built on `docker/sandbox-templates:shell-docker`
# (which acq also uses as the default ACQ_MSB_IMAGE), whose PUBLISHED base-image
# requirements are (Docker kit-reference, "Base image requirements"):
#   - a non-root `agent` user at UID 1000 with PASSWORDLESS SUDO
#   - a /home/agent home directory owned by `agent`
#   - HTTP proxy env (HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/NO_PROXY) PRESERVED ACROSS SUDO
#   - the agent binary (baked in, or installed via commands.install)
# The default image satisfies the first three already, so this step is a
# short-circuit there (the marker/`id agent` check returns early, and the
# sudoers block merely re-asserts NOPASSWD, which is harmless). A plain OCI base
# override (e.g. node:22-bookworm, which ships `node` at uid 1000 and no `agent`,
# and no sudoers rule) meets NONE of the first three. The msb adapter therefore
# synthesizes them here so both the kits (which run as `-u 1000`) and the agent
# behave as they do on sbx. Idempotent + marker-gated; runs fully offline
# (useradd/adduser/sudoers edits need no network). The uid defaults to 1000; if
# 1000 is taken (e.g. by `node` on a plain base), `agent` is created at the next

# ~/.profile, so without the bridge even `bash -l` skips ~/.bashrc on images

# forward on a RUNNING sandbox that acq is re-attaching to. See ADR-0021.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the provision path wires the forward (emit --vsock, start the
# socat bridge, write the /var/lib/acq/ssh-auth-sock marker), and the
# stopped→resume path (acq_backend_start) restarts the bridge from that marker.
# But re-attaching to an ALREADY-RUNNING sandbox goes through neither: the heal
# loop skips acq_backend_start (the sandbox is already running), so nothing
# re-drives forwarding. That left two live gaps where the guest process env got
# NO `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` on re-attach (attach/exec/kit only inject it when the marker
# is non-empty):
#   1. the marker had never been written (sandbox created before forwarding was
#      configured, or provision skipped the bridge), yet the host agent is now
#      available and the create-time --vsock route is present; and
#   2. the bridge process had died in-flight on a long-lived running sandbox.
# Re-driving here, keyed off the SAME opt-in signal as provision (a host
# SSH_AUTH_SOCK that yields a forward), closes both.
#
# Gated so it is a cheap no-op in the common case:
#   - host forward requested? (acq_host_socket_forwards emits an ssh-agent line)
#   - guest actually has the create-time --vsock route? (the route is create-time
#     only — it cannot be added to a running sandbox, so if it is absent, a bridge
#     would be inert and we must NOT write a misleading marker)
# When both hold, flip the module forwarding flag (so _acq_msb_check_socat and
# the bridge starter resolve the guest sock from the constant, not a possibly
# empty marker), verify socat, then start the bridge + write the marker — exactly
# the provision sequence. Fail-soft throughout: this is convenience, never fatal.
