# acq How-To Guide

> The [README](../../README.md) is the quickstart — the fast path to a running
> sandbox. This guide is the deeper how-to for `acq`, the entry point. It
> provides a pluggable-backend architecture supporting two backends — **msb**
> (microsandbox, the default) and **sbx** (Docker Sandboxes) — sharing one
> neutral kit vocabulary. Install a backend and `acq` runs the same commands on
> either one.

---

## Choose a backend

`acq` runs the same commands on either backend; you only choose the backend
once (install one, and it auto-detects). Pick the one that fits your environment:

| Backend | Install | Fits when |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **msb** | `brew install GSA-TTS/tap/microsandbox-acq` | You want a FOSS microVM runtime, no Docker seat, snapshots |
| **sbx** | `brew install docker/tap/sbx && sbx login` | You have Docker and want the commercial product |

See [docs/BACKEND_GUIDE.md](../BACKEND_GUIDE.md) for a full comparison. `acq`
auto-detects an installed backend (msb preferred when both are present); persist
a choice with `acq backend set <sbx|msb>` or `acq doctor`.

---

## Quick Start

> **msb is the default backend.** The steps below walk the **msb** path (what
> `acq` uses by default). If you specifically want the **sbx** backend, see
> [Prerequisites (sbx)](#step-1-alt-prerequisites-sbx) and
> [Running on the sbx backend](#running-on-the-sbx-backend). The common commands,
> secrets, and rotation subsections apply to either backend.

### Step 1: Prerequisites (msb)

Complete the standard setup in [README.md](../../README.md#5-minute-quickstart):

- Install the `msb` CLI: `brew install GSA-TTS/tap/microsandbox-acq`, or
  `./scripts/verify-msb-pin --install`. Not the upstream one-liner: it always
  installs the newest release, and `acq` refuses msb 0.7.0-0.7.2
  ([ADR-0032](../adr/0032-msb-version-policy-and-migration-recovery.md))
- Run `msb doctor` (add `--fix` to set up KVM/HVF/WHP virtualization)
- Set your network policy

Re-run `msb doctor` once more after setup — a clean `doctor` pass is the quickest
way to confirm the host is ready before your first `acq run` (and, if an
established setup later starts failing every outbound call at once, a wipe +
reinstall then `msb doctor` is the first thing to try; see
[Troubleshooting](../BACKEND_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting)).

You do **not** need to gather a USAi key or GitHub token in advance — `acq`
prompts you for the USAi key on first run and offers to scope a GitHub token
when your workspace has GitHub repos. Set them ahead of time only when
pre-seeding a machine or scripting setup (see [Secrets](#secrets) below).

<h4 id="step-1-alt-prerequisites-sbx">Step 1 (alternate): Prerequisites (sbx)</h4>

To use the **sbx** backend instead:

- Install the `sbx` CLI (>= 0.39.0)
- Run `sbx login`
- Set your network policy

See [Running on the sbx backend](#running-on-the-sbx-backend) for the full sbx
walkthrough.

### Step 2: Run a sandbox

```bash
./acq run opencode /path/to/your/project
```

`/path/to/your/project` is the folder the agent works in — an **existing
project** or a **new, empty folder** you just created. If it's a software
project, run `git init .` in it first so the agent can track its changes.

That's it. `acq run` creates the sandbox if it doesn't exist, heals any missing
kits, validates your USAi key, and attaches the agent.

> [!NOTE]
> The **first** run boots a microVM, applies kits, and prepares the agent — a
> minute or two, with a progress spinner and status lines so you can follow
> along. Later runs are much faster. Set `ACQ_NO_PROGRESS=1` to silence the
> animation (plain status lines still print); `ACQ_DEBUG=1` also disables it in
> favor of a timestamped trace.

### Step 3: Common commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `./acq run opencode /proj` | Create+attach (or re-attach) a sandbox |
| `./acq create opencode /proj` | Create detached (no attach) |
| `./acq ls` | List your sandboxes |
| `./acq stop NAME` | Stop a sandbox |
| `./acq rm NAME` | Remove a sandbox |
| `./acq shell NAME` | Open an interactive shell in a sandbox |
| `./acq exec NAME -- CMD` | Run a command inside a sandbox |
| `./acq cp SRC DST` | Copy files in/out (NAME:path syntax) |
| `./acq ports NAME` | Show the sandbox's published port mappings |
| `./acq version` | Show acq version + active backend |
| `./acq doctor` | Backend health check + write default config |

### Secrets

Setting secrets up front is **optional** — `acq run` validates your USAi key and
prompts you to set or rotate it when it's missing or expired, and offers to
scope a GitHub token when your workspace has GitHub repos. Set them explicitly
when you want to pre-seed a machine, script setup, or run in CI:

```bash
# USAi key — global (available to all sandboxes)
./acq secret set -g usai

# USAi key — scoped to one sandbox only (safe for testing)
./acq secret set my-sandbox usai

# GitHub token — global
./acq secret set -g github

# Arbitrary custom endpoint — global
./acq secret set -g myservice --host api.example.com --env MY_API_KEY
```

`acq` injects secrets into the sandbox at runtime; the real values never enter
the guest.

> [!WARNING]
> A broad token — one from `gh auth token`, or a classic PAT — carries
> **account-wide** scopes (`repo`, `workflow`, `delete_repo`, …). Stored globally
> (`-g`), it is injected into **every** sandbox, so an agent working on one
> project can act as you on **all** your repositories. Prefer a per-sandbox
> fine-grained token scoped to just the mounted repos:
>
> ```bash
> ./acq github-scope <sandbox-name> /path/to/your/project
> ```
>
> This is also what `acq run` offers interactively. If you omit the path later,
> `acq github-scope <sandbox-name>` uses the workspace recorded when the sandbox
> was created. Fine-grained tokens can't contribute to public repos you're not a
> member of, call the Checks API, or span multiple owners in one token — fall back
> to a global token for those cases. See
> [ADR-0013](../adr/0013-per-sandbox-github-token-downscoping.md).

### Rotate your USAi key

USAi API keys expire every **7 days**, which is the most common cause of
authentication errors like:

```text
Unauthorized: {"detail":"Not authenticated"}
```

**Rotate on the host without restarting your sandbox.** You do not need to tear
down or re-attach a running sandbox to swap in a fresh key — run the rotation
command from the host and the new value is stored in `acq`'s secret store, ready
for the next request:

1. Open <https://gsa.usai.gov/console/key-management>.
2. Choose **Rotate** from the **Actions** menu for your key.
3. Copy the new key using the console **copy button** (selecting the displayed
   text by hand can truncate it).
4. With the key in your paste buffer, run:

   ```bash
   ./acq usai-rotate-api-key
   ```

   It prompts for the new key, then validates it in a temporary sandbox.
   Rotation runs through the active backend (msb or sbx), so it works regardless
   of which backend you use. Source checkouts also carry `scripts/rotate-apikey`,
   a thin compatibility shim that forwards to `acq usai-rotate-api-key`.

`acq` also validates your key on attach and offers to rotate it then, but the
subcommand above is the direct path — no session restart required.

If a rotated key is still rejected, it was likely truncated on copy — see
[Known Failure Modes §20](../KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md#20-authentication-failed-after-copying-a-new-key).

### Bring Your Own Key (Multi-Provider LLM Endpoints)

In addition to USAi (`usai`), `acq` supports first-class **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**
for external and custom generative LLM endpoints ([ADR-0035](../adr/0035-multi-provider-byok-endpoints.md)):

| Provider ID | Default Host | Base URL | Injected Env Var |
|-------------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| `usai` | `api.gsa.usai.gov` | `https://api.gsa.usai.gov/api/v1` | `USAI_API_KEY` |
| `openrouter` | `openrouter.ai` | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `openai` | `api.openai.com` | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `anthropic` | `api.anthropic.com` | `https://api.anthropic.com/v1` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `gemini` | `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| `custom` | User-configured (`--host`) | User-configured (`--base-url`) | User-configured (`--env`) |

```bash
# 1. Configure a built-in provider (e.g., OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
./acq configure --provider openrouter
./acq secret set -g openrouter
./acq run opencode /path/to/your/project

# 2. Override provider for a single invocation
./acq run opencode /path/to/your/project --provider openai

# 3. Configure any custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint
./acq configure --provider custom \
  --host api.together.xyz \
  --base-url https://api.together.xyz/v1 \
  --env TOGETHER_API_KEY
./acq secret set -g custom --host api.together.xyz --env TOGETHER_API_KEY
./acq run opencode /path/to/your/project

# 4. Rotate any provider's API key on the host
./acq rotate-api-key openrouter
```

## Installing acq

Most users should use the one-line installer in the
[README quickstart](../../README.md#step-2-install-acq) — it auto-selects the
best method already on your Mac or Linux host (Homebrew → npm → self-contained
download), puts `acq` on your `PATH`, and never needs administrator rights. This
section covers the manual, developer, and Windows preview paths.

### Direct package-manager install

The one-line installer detects Homebrew and npm automatically. To run the direct
command yourself:

```bash
npm install -g github:GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-quickstart   # if you use Node/npm
brew install GSA-TTS/tap/acq                              # if you use Homebrew
```

Package-manager installs give you `upgrade`/`uninstall` for free.

### Windows preview install

Windows support is a preview path for Windows 11 hosts using the `msb` backend.
It is installed from the GitHub release zip with PowerShell; npm remains scoped
to macOS/Linux until Windows path and secret-storage behavior are fully
validated. The preview runs the existing Bash `acq` implementation through Git
Bash. The installer probes Windows Hypervisor Platform and stops when it is not
usable, but it does not try to enable Windows features, elevate PowerShell, or
reboot the machine.

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```powershell
irm https://github.com/GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-quickstart/releases/download/v4.0.1/install.ps1 | iex
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

For an inspect-first install:

```powershell
$AcqVersion = "4.0.1" # x-release-please-version
$BaseUrl = "https://github.com/GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-quickstart/releases/download/v$AcqVersion"
Invoke-WebRequest "$BaseUrl/install.ps1" -OutFile install.ps1
Get-Content .\install.ps1
.\install.ps1 -DryRun
.\install.ps1
```

Running `.\install.ps1` (and the installed `acq`, via `acq.cmd`) requires a
PowerShell **execution policy** that permits local scripts. Windows 11 client
defaults to `Restricted`, so those steps fail with `PSSecurityException` on an
otherwise default host; allow local scripts for your user with
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` (or use the `irm ... | iex`
one-liner, which is not affected because piped text is not a script file). On a
managed device the policy may be set by Group Policy.

If WHP is disabled, stop: enable it from an **elevated** PowerShell
(`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName HypervisorPlatform -All`),
restart, and re-run the installer. On a managed device, ask your IT administrator
to enable "Windows Hypervisor Platform" out of band.

### Windows preview validation

Run these checks from PowerShell on a Windows 11 host with WHP already enabled.
The PowerShell path is the supported Windows preview shell; `acq.cmd` is only a
convenience shim. These checks are intentionally manual until the project has a
reliable Windows runner with local virtualization available. The first step runs
`install.ps1` directly, so the shell needs an execution policy that allows local
scripts (see the note above) — a default `Restricted` client fails with
`PSSecurityException`.

```powershell
# Installer dry run; should print planned actions and make no changes.
.\install.ps1 -DryRun

# After install, acq should resolve from PATH and delegate through Git Bash.
Get-Command acq
acq version

# Confirm msb is installed and the host is ready.
msb --version
msb doctor

# Smoke-test a shell sandbox against a path with spaces.
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:TEMP\acq windows smoke" | Out-Null
acq --backend msb run shell "$env:TEMP\acq windows smoke"
```

If any command fails, capture the full command, output, Windows version, `msb
--version`, and whether the machine is managed by enterprise policy.

This checklist was validated on a Windows 11 host (build 26200): the installer
dry-run/help, a real release-zip install (with SHA-256 verification) on a host
with no sandbox runtime preinstalled — the installer detected the missing `msb`,
prompted, and installed it via the upstream Windows installer — `acq version`
through `acq.cmd`, `msb --version` / `msb doctor`, and sandbox provisioning all
worked. Notes from that validation:

- The launcher and installer resolve Git Bash from Git for Windows' standard
  install locations and deliberately ignore the WSL interop shim
  (`C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`) that a bare `bash.exe` PATH lookup often
  returns. If `acq` still lands in WSL, run it from a Git Bash terminal or add
  Git for Windows' `bin` directory to your PATH.
- The installer checks WHP by probing the WHP API (`WHvCreatePartition`), the
  same signal `msb` uses, rather than the DISM feature flag — the flag can report
  `Disabled` on hosts where WHP genuinely works (WSL2/VirtualMachine Platform,
  VBS, or a virtualized guest). Treat `msb doctor` as the authoritative readiness
  check.
- `acq run` gates on a stored USAi key and validates it against the USAi API
  before creating a sandbox, so the smoke test's last command and the full first
  run require **GSA network reachability** (e.g. the GSA VPN) plus a key
  (`acq secret set -g usai`). Off the GSA network, `acq run` stops at the key
  gate with a clear message.

### Manual install (from a clone)

If you're comfortable in a terminal and prefer to run `acq` from a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GSA-TTS/agentic-coding-quickstart.git
cd agentic-coding-quickstart
./acq run opencode ~/my-project
```

You'll also need the `msb` sandbox runtime — install it without admin via
`brew install GSA-TTS/tap/microsandbox-acq`, or `./scripts/verify-msb-pin
--install` if you have no Homebrew. Avoid
`curl -fsSL https://install.microsandbox.dev | sh`: it always installs the newest
release, and `acq` refuses msb 0.7.0-0.7.2 (see §43 of
[`KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md`](../KNOWN_FAILURE_MODES.md)).

> **Running `./acq` from the clone?** It only works from **inside** the
> `agentic-coding-quickstart` folder (that's where the `acq` file lives). If you
> get "no such file `./acq`", `cd` back into that folder first. The one-line
> installer avoids this entirely by putting `acq` on your `PATH`.

#### Testing a specific tagged release

After cloning, check out the tag:

```bash
git checkout v3.0.0-rc2
```

Git prints a message about a **"detached HEAD" state** — that's **normal, not an
error.** It just means you're on a specific snapshot. Run `acq` as usual; to go
back to the latest, run `git switch main`.

---

## Backend Selection

`acq` resolves the active backend in this priority order:

1. `--backend <name>` flag (per-invocation override)
2. `ACQ_BACKEND` environment variable
3. `backend:` in `~/.config/acq/config.yaml`
4. Auto-detect: first installed backend found (msb preferred, then sbx)

**Today (1.2.x), two backends ship: `msb` (default) and `sbx`.** See
[docs/BACKEND_GUIDE.md](../BACKEND_GUIDE.md) for per-backend details. A third
backend (`ppp` — Podman-Plus-Proxy) is deferred.

### Persist the default backend

```bash
# Write `backend: msb` (or sbx) to ~/.config/acq/config.yaml
./acq backend set msb
./acq backend set sbx

# Or run doctor and answer the prompt
./acq doctor
```

### Override for one invocation

```bash
./acq --backend sbx run opencode /proj
./acq --backend msb run opencode /proj
```

---

## Running on the msb backend (default)

```bash
# 1. Install msb (microsandbox) and confirm the host is ready.
#    A version-pinned channel, because acq refuses msb 0.7.0-0.7.2 and the
#    upstream one-liner always resolves to the newest release.
brew install GSA-TTS/tap/microsandbox-acq   # or: ./scripts/verify-msb-pin --install
msb doctor          # checks KVM/HVF/WHP; msb doctor --fix to set up

# 2. Provide the USAi key.
#    INTERACTIVE (recommended): skip this line — `acq run` prompts you for the
#    key on first run, or set it once with:  ./acq secret set -g usai
#    (prompts for the value; it never lands in argv or your shell history).
#
#    NON-INTERACTIVE / scripting / CI only: msb binds the key from a host env var
#    at create (the real value never enters the guest). Read it WITHOUT echoing
#    so it does not leak into shell history:
read -rs -p 'USAi API key: ' USAI_API_KEY; export USAI_API_KEY; echo

# 3. Run — acq auto-detects msb, or force it with --backend msb
./acq --backend msb run opencode /path/to/your/project
```

msb takes native shortcuts where it has a strictly-better primitive — e.g. the
Zscaler CA kit uses `--trust-host-cas` instead of the file-drop mechanism. Kit
behavior is otherwise identical across backends.

## Running on the sbx backend

```bash
# 1. Install the sbx CLI (>= 0.39.0) and authenticate
#    (see https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/ — the standalone sbx CLI,
#     NOT the deprecated `docker sandbox`)
sbx login
sbx policy set <your-network-policy>

# 2. Run — acq uses sbx when it is your only backend or you have existing sbx
#    sandboxes, or force it with --backend sbx
./acq --backend sbx run opencode /path/to/your/project
```

For sbx-specific detail (proxy secrets, network policy), see the
[full sbx guide](sbx.md). For the backend-neutral way to mount
multiple directories, see [Multiple Workspaces](../CONCEPTS.md#multiple-workspaces).

### msb host setup

msb runs each sandbox as a lightweight microVM, so the host must provide
hardware virtualization. `msb doctor` is the authoritative check (and
`msb doctor --fix` attempts supported setup changes); the per-platform
requirements below mirror the [microsandbox docs](https://microsandbox.dev):

**Linux** — a glibc-based distribution with KVM enabled.

```bash
# KVM device present?
test -e /dev/kvm && echo ok

# CPU virtualization exposed? (non-zero = vmx/svm present)
grep -Ec '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
```

A missing `/dev/kvm` (or a `0` from the second command) means virtualization is
disabled in firmware, unavailable on the machine, or hidden by an outer VM. If
your user lacks access to the device, add yourself to the `kvm` group once:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG kvm "$USER" && newgrp kvm
```

**macOS** — Apple Silicon (M-series). Intel Macs are **not supported** for the
local runtime, and Rosetta does not change that. Nothing to enable ahead of
time: Apple Silicon Macs include the hypervisor support msb uses.

**Windows 11** — Windows support is in **preview**. Local sandboxes need the
**Windows Hypervisor Platform** feature (this is separate from the
`VirtualMachinePlatform` feature that WSL2 and Docker Desktop enable). The
Windows preview installer probes WHP and stops when it is not usable; it does not
elevate PowerShell, enable the feature, or reboot the machine.

Enable WHP yourself from an **elevated** PowerShell
(`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName HypervisorPlatform -All`),
then restart (see the [README box](../../README.md#step-1-open-a-terminal)). On a
managed device, ask your IT administrator; then re-run the installer or
`msb doctor`.

**Inside a cloud VM, CI runner, or another hypervisor** — the outer environment
must expose **nested virtualization** before `/dev/kvm` (or the equivalent) is
available to msb. Many hosted CI runners and cloud VMs do not enable it by
default.

---

## Managing kits

Kits are authored once in the neutral `hybrid/v1` vocabulary and translated to
the active backend automatically. Inspect and manage them with:

```bash
./acq kit list                    # show the pinned kits + patterns ref
./acq kit validate ./my-kit/      # validate a neutral kit dir or spec.yaml
./acq kit apply my-sandbox KITREF # apply a kit to an existing sandbox
```

### Keeping existing sandboxes current

`acq` pins the built-in kit bundle to one commit of the patterns repo. **New**
sandboxes get the pinned bundle automatically; for an **existing** sandbox, `acq`
can tell you if it is behind and refresh it in place:

```bash
./acq kit check my-sandbox        # is this sandbox on the pinned bundle?
./acq kit update my-sandbox       # refresh the bundle in place (asks first)
```

`acq run` also offers a refresh when a sandbox is behind; it defaults to No and
never blocks a launch. Refreshes are in place (sessions, secrets, and project
files are kept). Skip the automatic check with `ACQ_UPDATE_CHECK=0` or
`./acq run --no-update-check`.

See [ADR-0016](../adr/0016-kit-bundle-provenance-and-stale-refresh.md) for the full
design and trust model.

---

## Interactive setup: `acq configure`

`acq configure` is a colorful, dependency-free interactive picker for choosing
which **opt-in** kits to enable and the default answer for per-sandbox GitHub
token scoping. Choices persist to `~/.config/acq/config.yaml`.

```bash
acq configure
```

- The four built-in kits are always applied; the picker only manages opt-in
  extras (e.g. `openchamber`, `paseo`).
- `acq` offers to run this on your first run; run it again anytime.
- `acq create` re-shows the picker pre-filled with your saved defaults, so one
  sandbox can deviate without changing the global default (the deviation is
  remembered per-sandbox and re-applied on resume).
- The token preference only pre-answers the scoping prompt — the fine-grained
  PAT is still minted per-sandbox (`acq github-scope`).
- Non-interactive/CI runs make no changes and just print the current config; set
  `ACQ_NO_PROMPT=1` to force that. See
  [ADR-0031](../adr/0031-interactive-acq-configure.md).

---

## Advanced: extra kits

```bash
# Apply an extra kit on every invocation
export ACQ_EXTRA_KITS="./my-local-kit git+https://github.com/acme/kits.git#ref=<sha>&dir=some-kit"

# Allow a new kit source prefix
export ACQ_EXTRA_KIT_SOURCES="github.com/acme/"
```

An exported `ACQ_EXTRA_KITS` takes precedence over the kits saved by
`acq configure` (env wins): the create-time picker is skipped and your env value
is used verbatim.

You can also apply an extra kit for a single `run`/`create` with `--kit`
(repeatable), instead of the env var:

```bash
# One-off: apply a local kit dir (or a git+https ref)
acq run opencode --kit ./my-local-kit .
acq create opencode --kit ./kit-a --kit git+https://github.com/acme/kits.git#ref=<sha>&dir=some-kit /proj
```

`--kit` refs are translated by `acq` exactly like `ACQ_EXTRA_KITS` entries (a
neutral `hybrid/v1` kit is converted to the active backend's format), so they
work with any backend — they are **not** forwarded raw to the backend CLI.

---

## Progress output

During the long, quiet phases of `acq run` (booting the microVM, installing the
agent, fetching/applying kits), `acq` prints status lines and — on an
interactive terminal — an animated spinner, so you can tell work is happening.

- **Interactive terminal:** spinner + status lines.
- **Piped / redirected / CI:** plain status lines only (no animation), so logs
  stay clean.
- `ACQ_NO_PROGRESS=1` — never animate; still print the plain status lines.
- `ACQ_DEBUG=1` — disables the spinner in favor of a timestamped trace.

Progress output goes to **stderr**, so a piped stdout stays uncluttered.

---

## Exec timeout tuning

The default timeout for waiting for the backend's exec (`sbx exec` / `msb exec`,
via `acq exec`) to become ready after a sandbox starts is 60 seconds. Override:

```bash
export ACQ_EXEC_READY_TIMEOUT=120
```
