# test-acq-lib.sh — shared stub library for the acq bats test suite.
#
# This file is SOURCED (never executed directly) by test/bats/helper.bash, which
# every test/bats/*.bats file loads. It provides:
#   - the stub scaffolding (make_stubs/cleanup_stubs) for sbx/msb/ssh/ssh-keygen,
#     driven through $CALLS
#   - load_acq (source acq + the sbx adapter with the ACQ_SOURCE_ONLY guard)
#   - REPO_ROOT / ACQ, the offline kit-dir, retry-backoff neutralization, and the
#     shared MSB_GITHUB_SECRET_BINDING constant the .bats files assert against
#
# It began as the shared harness for the bespoke scripts/test-acq runner (and its
# scripts/test-acq.d/NN-*.sh parts). That runner was retired once the suite was
# migrated to bats-core (ADR-0025); this library survives because it is the
# valuable, framework-agnostic STUB layer, now consumed by the bats helper. bats
# provides the assertions (bats-assert) and the pass/fail tally, so the old
# hand-rolled pass/fail/assert_* and PASS/FAIL counters are gone.

set -uo pipefail

# Detach stdin from any terminal for the whole suite. acq's interactive prompts
# (key-gate rotate, github-scope advisory, stale-bundle refresh, doctor
# default-write) gate on `[ -t 0 ]` and READ stdin when it is a TTY. A @test that
# reaches a prompt path incidentally would otherwise BLOCK when run from an
# interactive terminal (CI pipes stdin, so it never hung there). Reopening stdin
# from /dev/null once, here, makes every prompt take its non-interactive branch
# regardless of how the suite was launched. @tests that feed input still pipe it
# explicitly (that overrides this). bats runs each @test in its own process, so
# this redirect is inherited by every test that sources the helper.

# msb equivalent: resolve every REMOTE kit ref to a local empty spec dir instead
# of a real git fetch. This keeps the suite network-free for the msb
# heal/provision paths (acq_backend_provision / acq_backend_ensure_kits_applied),
# including when acq is invoked as a CHILD process, where a test cannot shadow
# _acq_msb_fetch_kit. Local kit paths still pass through unchanged, so tests that
# supply an explicit local kit dir (e.g. mid-life apply) are unaffected;
# in-process tests that override _acq_msb_fetch_kit still win for the refs they
# pass. On a CI host with git + network this prevents a real fetch that would
# otherwise hang.
#
# bats sources this helper once per @test (each in its own process), so a plain
# `mktemp -d` here would leak one dir per test with no single EXIT trap to clean
# them. Instead root a SINGLE shared offline-kit dir under bats' run-scoped
# temp dir (BATS_RUN_TMPDIR, which bats removes at the end of the run); fall back
# to a per-process mktemp only when run outside bats. The dir holds a stub spec
# with no secrets, so sharing it across tests is safe.
